# CPTR-405

This repository is for use in CPTR 405 (Mobile Application Development) based on Zybooks

I also developed a dice rolling application that is optimized for DnD and other roleplaying games 
allowing you to share data between characters for ease of use. 
All applications can be run through the use of Android Studios.
