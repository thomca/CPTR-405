# Character Link Rolling
I devloped this app to include features such as graphics, animation, and the use of a database. 
Some of the more interesting problems that I worked with include a scrolling list embedded 
in a DialogFragment, working with fragments, and setting up the database system. 

As for functionality, this app allows you to save information about characters 
and preset dice rolls which can be shared between classes. I had a lot of fun designing 
this and I hope that you enjoy it or find something useful to apply to your own project.
